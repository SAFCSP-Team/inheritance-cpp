# Inheritance


 **Objective**
 
In this project, we will learn to understand inheritance in C++ and how it can be applied to create a hierarchy of related classes with shared properties and behaviors.

**Problem**

Create a hierarchy of animals using `inheritance` to represent different species and their characteristics.

**Implementation**

* Create a base class named `Animal` that initializes name and age attributes, and eat and sound methods.
* Implement derived classes for specific animal species, such as `Mammal` and `Bird` with unique properties and behaviors.
* Override the `eat()` and `sound()` methods in each derived class to provide specialized implementations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
    /* your code here */
int main() {

    return 0;
}
```
