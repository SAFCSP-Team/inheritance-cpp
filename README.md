# Inheritance


## Objective
In this project, we will learn to understand inheritance in C++ and how it can be applied to create a hierarchy of related classes with shared properties and behaviors.

## Problem

Create a hierarchy of `animals` using `inheritance` to represent different species and their characteristics.

## Implementation

* Create a base class named Animal that initializes name and age attribute, and eat and sound methods.
* Implement derived classes for specific animal species, such as Mammals and Birds with unique properties and behaviors.
* Override the eat() and sound() methods in each derived class to provide specialized implementations.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {

    return 0;
}
```
